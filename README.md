# gc__gvmi_hash
Summary: computes the hash of a gvmi image file. 

Problem:
The gvmi-kit Python package/script computes the hash of a gvmi image during its push operation. However, a Requestor is required to provide the pushed image hash in its requestor script, and if lost, has no means provided by gvmi-kit to re-output the image hash. Further, the current Golem documentation neither specifies the hashing algorithm used (sha3-224) nor a suggests tool for recomputation.

The supplied gv__gvmi_hash.py solves a lost hash problem by hashing the input image file using the same algorithm as, and with no additional runtime dependencies than those already satisfied by, the gvmi-kit package -- namely the Python Standard Library + OpenSSL libraries. Note, the script is equivalent to invoking `openssl dgst -sha3-224 <gvmi-image>` on systems where openssl executables have been installed. The reader is encouraged to see the code in gvmkit-build itself (viz Credits) to be assured that the hashing algorithm is consistent.

--Note: to understand better what problem this script solves, it is recommended the reader follow the Provider Flash Tutorial (Python) at https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development. --

Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/krunch3r76/gc__gvmi_hash.git
python3 gc__gvmi_hash/gc__gvmi_hash.py <gvmi-image>
```

Example:
```
(cracker-venv) krunch3r@crystalcavern:~/hash-cracker$ python3 gc__gvmi_hash/gc__gvmi_hash.py *.gvmi
SHA3-224(docker-hash-cracker-latest-363b2e9df2.gvmi)= e1a95ab266977b857ae1c59942ebc7384a72359840b452c2e5293737
SHA3-224(docker-hash-cracker-latest-e93d21fba0.gvmi)= 4c9778760794a5fa6b8461ed2654c09cbc20f16edd3ec687c3289db8
```

Recommendations:
Consider placing community scripts such as this in $HOME/.local/bin/golem-community or $env:UserProfile/bin/golem-community and adding it to your path. You may also consider adding said community scripts path to the environment variable PYTHONPATH and calling from gc__gvmi_hash import gc__gvmi_hash in order to utilize the function from within scripts, e.g. requestor.py.

TODO: provide hints on adding community scripts into the Python venv instead.

# pre: file is readable, MEBIBYTES defined
# process:
#   open gvmi image
#   on each chunk
#       send to hasher
#   query hasher
# output: hash as string
# post: none

```

Reflections:
The code can be reduced to just a few lines if the image is slurped into memory in one gulp as opposed to "chunking." However, it reduces memory usage by never storing in memory at most two copies of the entire VM image at one time. Furthermore, OpenSSL could be calculating the hash based on a previous state per chunk and discarding prior chunks, or may do so in the future. Therefore, reduced memory complexity from chunking offers cost-savings and performance benefits on memory constrained virtual servers or devices, and nominal read operation costs on any system.
